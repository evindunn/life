                    It's an algorithm that produces really organic-looking movement. To me, it looks like
                    cells dividing or something. But cooler because it's more pixelated & geometric.

                    The Game below is a grid of squares (or "cells"), each with a value "alive" or "dead". My
                    version of the game updates every time your monitor does (usually 60 times per second).
                    Each update of the game is called a "tick".
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each tick, the cells change based on the following rules:
                </p>

                    <li>
                        A live cell with less than two live neighbors dies (Abandoned by its friends)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives (Power in numbers)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A live cell with more than three neighbors dies (Overpopulation)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive (Reproduction)
                    </li>

                My version has a couple of additional rules because your browser doesn't have infinite
                processing power.
